/**
 * Here we provide very basic styling that most UI's will need. These styles
 * are applied at the most global level being applied via element selectors.
 * Everything in Base needs to be easily overridden which is really easy to do
 * as everything in Base sits right at the bottom in terms of specificity.
 *
 * Some of this styling builds on top of Shell's "Base".

/* 1. Body element

/**
 * 1. We apply `display: flex;` in order to easily get the main "Layout ->
 *    Template" elements to be the height of the remaining viewport. And make
 *    all the "Layout -> Template" elements be stacked in a linear fashion.
 * 2. We set the `body` element to always be the height of the viewport and
 *    disable vertical scrolling as we only want scrolling in the Builder and
 *    Builder Controls sections, see "Layout -> Template -> App".
